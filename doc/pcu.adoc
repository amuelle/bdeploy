= PCU (Process Control Unit)

The PCU consumes a pre-rendered (meaning all parameter value variables are resolved, all paths are absolute, etc.) configuration to control and run locally.

The PCU does not make any assumptions about locations, etc. It relies completely on external sources to prepare a DeploymentDescriptor and the according ApplicationDeploymentDescriptors.

These descriptors can be used with DeploymentLaunch and ApplicationLaunch to start, monitor and stop processes.

The PCU is designed to be used in an asynchronous manner. "Somebody" should repeatedly execute the Callable.call method with is implemented by all Launchable implementations. In most cases this means that somebody will register a DeploymentLaunch as Callable in a ScheduledExecutorService.

Once the loop is running, call setExpectedState on each Launchable to control the state of deployments and/or individual applications.
