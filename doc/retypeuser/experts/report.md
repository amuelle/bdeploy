# Reports

**BDeploy** provides users with the ability to generate reports.

### Prerequisites

To use the reporting feature, the user must have **READ** level permissions for the specific report they wish to view. These permissions can be assigned through the **Administration** section, under [User Accounts](/experts/system#user-accounts) or [User Groups](/experts/system#user-groups).
