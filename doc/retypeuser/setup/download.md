# Download

The latest and greatest BDeploy version can be downloaded on the official Github page: https://github.com/bdeployteam/bdeploy/releases

Extract the BDeploy binaries from the distribution ZIP. There are no requirements regarding the location of the binaries. The target of the unpack will contain a _bin/bdeploy_ or _bin/bdeploy.bat_ depending on whether the distribution is built for `Linux` (_bdeploy-linux64-X.Y.Z.zip_) or `Windows` (_bdeploy-win64-X.Y.Z.zip_).

For easier handling, make sure the unzipped 'bin' folder is on the PATH. The rest of the manual assumes you have done this. If you decide to omit this step you will have to prefix all commands with the correct path to the binaries.
