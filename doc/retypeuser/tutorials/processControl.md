# How can I see what's up and running?

The status of an **Instance** is visualized in the **Instance Dashboard**.

1. The individual process status is displayed with the according process - in the table row, or on the card, depending on the view mode.
2. The individual process status is displayed in even more detail when clicking a process in the **Process Details Panel**.
3. The overall **Node** state is displayed _above_ the individual process list, and is also visible in _collapsed mode_. This overall status displays whether the current state is the expected state for a _running_ instance. More explicitly this means if there is a green checkmark, all processes of start type `INSTANCE` are running.

The [Process Control](/user/processcontrol/#process-control) chapters provide more details about the individual process states along with a state graph that visualizes the life cycle of a process.
