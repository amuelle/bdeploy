= BHive

The BHive (short: hive) provides a mechanism to store and transfer files over the network. It decouples storage of file content and hierarchical filesystem layout descriptions (trees). The mechanism is similar to how GIT stores files. File content is stored and identified by using the content's checksum.

Here some properties of BHive:

* The BHive uses a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree[Merkle Hash Tree] to store data much like GIT does (similar technology is also used for implementing blockchains).
* Consistency of objects can be verified by calculating the checksum of the content and comparing it with the name of the file storing that content.
* BHive knows four different types of objects: `BLOB` (any file content), `TREE` (a list of `BLOB`, `TREE`, `MREF` entries), `MREF` (a reference to a to-be-nested `MANIFEST`), `MANIFEST` (associates some meta-data with a root `TREE`).
* All known object types (except `MANIFEST`) are stored using the exact same mechanism (`ObjectDatabase`). This means verifying the consistency of whole trees is as simple as verifying consistency of individual files.
* `MANIFEST` are stored in a separate `ManifestDatabase`, this is to allow named storage and reference to `MANIFEST`, since they are the top-level entry point into the BHive. Most high level operations will require `Manifest.Key` objects as parameters.
* BHive has a command line tooling to allow direct manipulation of local and remote hives: `io.bdeploy.bhive.cli.BHiveCli`
* BHive has a standalone server (using the above cli) which allows serving BHives without BDeploy.
* A `io.bdeploy.bhive.BHive` does not expose API, use `Hive.Operation` defined in the `io.bdeploy.bhive.op` package to programmatically interact with a hive.
* `Hive.Operation` can be implemented externally, to provide new functionality operating on a BHive from the outside.

== BHive Tour

This chapter, along with the launch configuration available in the bhive project, will give a short tour around most
of the functionality that bhive provides.

All launch configurations used will use a BHive target in a runtime workspace in the containing workspace (`${workspace_loc}/runtime-hive`) in case you want to have a look at it.

=== Import

_Import_ is the act of digesting a folder recursively into a BHive storage. There are two important parameters: the source folder and the destination BHive. Since BHive creates an empty hive automatically in the destination, the target BHive directory is allowed to be non-existant. The source folder is not required to follow _any_ rules at this low-level stage. BHive will simply digest any file found recursively. While doing so, it separates each files content from it's name. They are stored in separate locations (content as 'blob', name is stored in a 'tree' as 'pointer' to the 'blob' for this file's content).

Use the *Hive-Import* launch configuration to import a directory into the BHive. The launch will prompt for two things:

. The folder to import. You can choose any folder to import. The target hive is created automatically if it does not exists.
. The name (manifest key) of the imported tree. This name can be used to reference the imported tree later on. Note that a name:tag combination must be unique. Import will fail if the manifest key is already used.

Note that all BHive objects are immutable, meaning that there are never changes to any existing file. This is analogous to GIT. Manifests are *not* BHive objects but more special (they just *reference* a root tree BHive object). They are mutable in that labels can be added and removed from the manifest.

=== List

You can list the content of the BHive after importing by running the *Hive-Manifest-List* launch configuration. It will simply list all available manifests in the BHive.

=== Export

The inverse operation of an _Import_ is (surprise) an _Export_, which means restoring a file/folder tree exactly as it was imported. The export will scan a manifest for 'tree' objects and write all 'blob' objects to the locations described there.

Run the *Hive-Export* launch configuration and specify a target folder (which may not yet exist). Next specify a manifest to export, use the key you specified during <<Import>>.

Check the directory, you will notice that all files have been written back on disc, and the folder content is equal to the one imported. 

=== Remote Serve

BHive provides a small embedded server which allows serving any number of local hives through HTTPS.

Run the *Hive-Remote-Serve* launch configuration to run the server, serving the BHive created with the *Hive-Import* application.

Note: the sample launch configurations use the test-only pre-built certificates from the _jersey_ project.

=== Remote List

The same list operation as before (*Hive-Manifest-List*) can be performed on the remote server as well, as long as *Hive-Remote-Serve* is still running.

Run *Hive-Remote-List* to try it - this will go through the HTTPS stack and perform the manifest listing remotely.

=== Remote Fetch & Push

The two tools _fetch_ and _push_ allow to fetch and push manifests along with all required objects from and to a remote hive.

Both operations are practically identical, just reversed. To demonstrate fetch, run *Hive-Remote-Fetch* and specify the manifest key you imported before. This will create a new (empty) hive (on first run) next to the one created by import (`${workspace_loc}/runtime-hive-fetched`) and fetch this manifest into that hive. Make sure that *Hive-Remote-Serve* is still running for this to work.

If you are interested, you can try to _import_ another folder which shares some parts with the first one you imported. Due to the separation of content and location, each common file will be stored only once, regardless of it's location (name) in the tree. This will also enable fetch/push to transfer only missing objects.

=== FSCK

The _FSCK_ (short for 'filesystem check') will check consistency of all objects and manifests in e BHive. Run *Hive-FSCK* to execute a _FSCK_ on the sample BHive.

=== Delete

Manifests can be deleted from a BHive as well. Run *Hive-Manifest-Delete* to delete a manifest. Be sure to give the same manifest key as with *Hive-Import*.

Note that this operation only deletes the manifest, but *not* automatically all now-unreferenced objects from the object database. This is done by <<Prune>>.

=== Prune

_Pruning_ is a cleanup operation which removes unreferenced objects from the storage. It is comparable to a _git gc_.

Run *Hive-Prune* after running *Hive-Manifest-Delete* to see the effects of pruning remaining objects. If you had only one manifest and deleted that, the result should be that the _objects_ directory in the hive contains no files anymore (only empty directories).

== TreeSnapshot & Co.

The `ScanOperation` allows to fetch a `TreeSnapshot` of a `MANIFEST` root tree. This allows to recursively retrieve all available/relevant information about a `MANIFEST`. This includes a listing of `TREE`, `BLOB`, `MREF`, missing/damaged objects, etc.

The `TreeDiff` allows to compare two `TreeSnapshot` objects. It will produce a `TreeElementDiff` for each element which is different in the two snapshots. This diff is based on the type and checksum of the according path entries in the snapshots. There is no actual content diff, but it is 'ease' to build one based on the available information.
