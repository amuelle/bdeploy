== Manifests

Almost all of *BDeploy*'s storage is encapsulated in *Manifests* in a *BHive*. This holds true not only for actual application/product data, but for any configuration data as well. These have a few advantages over traditional storage:

* Contents is immutable
* Contents is validatable (through checksums)
* Contents is automatically versioned
* Contents history is available

There are a bunch of *Manifests* for several purposes.

|===
|Manifest Name
|Purpose

|`InstanceGroupManifest`
|Stores information (name, description, logo) related to an *Instance Group*. There is exactly one `InstanceGroupManifest` per *Instance Group* *BHive*.

|`SoftwareRepositoryManifest`
|Stores information (name, description) related to a *Software Repository*. There is exactly one `SoftwareRepositoryManifest` per *Software Repository* *BHive*.

|`InstanceManifest`
|The `InstanceManifest` holds information about an instance and keeps track of the all `InstanceNodeManifest` for the *Instance*.

|`InstanceNodeManifest`
|Keeps track of the *Applications* and their configuration per configured *Node* in the *Instance*. A *Node* always corresponds to a registered *Slave* on the target *Master*.

|`ProductManifest`
|Holds information about a product and keeps track of all the `ApplicationManifest` for the *Product*.

|`ApplicationManifest`
|Holds information about a single application, includes the `app-info.yaml` for the application which holds information about all supported parameters, etc.

|`MinionManifest`
|Holds information about available slaves on a *master*.

|`UserDatabase`
|Manages special per-user *Manifests* which hold information about each user.

=== MetaManifests

In addition to traditional *Manifest* there are *MetaManifest*. These allow to _attach_ certain information to other *Manifests*. This allows to update the attached *MetaManifest* independently of the _immutable_ *Manifest*, whilst keeping all benefits of a *Manifest* for the *MetaManifest* as well (versioning, history, ...).

|MetaManifest Name
|Purpose

|`InstanceState`
|Keeps track of *Instance* state related information (installed *Instance* versions, activated *Instance* version, etc.).

|`InstanceManifestHistory`
|Keeps track of the history of an *Instance* version, storing timestamps at which certain actions happened (creation, installation, activation, etc.).

|`ManagedMasters`
|Keeps track of attached managed masters on a central master.

|`ControllingMaster`
|Keeps track of the responsible controlling master for a single *Instance*.
