= Minion (master/slave) Server

The minion is the main BDeploy deliverable. It contains all the command tools as well as the server for remote services and the configuration web UI.

Use `bdeploy init ...` to initalize a minion root, then use either `bdeploy master ...` or `bdeploy slave...` to launch a master (including web UI) or a slave (controlled by a master) from that root
