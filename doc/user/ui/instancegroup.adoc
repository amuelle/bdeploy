=== Instance Groups

The btn:[Instance Group] top-level page provides the entry point into the central mechanisms (*Instance* configuration). An *Instance Group* is exactly what the name says. It is a group of *Instances* (which define the configuration of a single _instance_ of a *Product*).

[NOTE]
An *Instance Group* has a 1:1 relationship with an independent *BHive* storage on the _master_. This means that a single *Instance Group* can be moved to a different storage (or server FWIW) without affecting another *Instance Group*.

Use the btn:[+] button to create a new *Instance Group*.

[NOTE]
Current, only _PNG_ images are supported as logo format.

The btn:[Instance Group] page shows a list of _recently used_ *Instance Groups* in the first row - which looks a little odd as long as there are not many *Instance Groups*. It will always contain the most recently used *Instance Groups* for the logged in user, which allows a quick return to previously/frequently visited *Instance Groups*.

[NOTE]
Of course you can also bookmark the location of an *Instance Group* in your browser.

==== Instance Management

When clicking an *Instance Group*, the *Instance Browser* for this group opens. Here you can see all *Instances* grouped by their _purpose_ (can be `DEVELOPMENT`, `TEST`, `PRODUCTIVE`).

Click an *Instance* to proceed to the <<_instance_configuration,Instance Configuration>>.

Since an *Instance* requires a *Product* (an *Instance* _instantiates_ a *Product*), an empty *Instance Group* will display a shortcut to the <<_product_management,Product Management>>. If there is an *Instance* already, there is the btn:[Manage Products...] in the lower right corner to go there instead.

To create a new *Instance*, click the btn:[+] button at the bottom of the page. You will have to select a *Product* to _instantiate_. The _tag_ of the *Product* can be changed later (_up-_ and _downgrade_). You will also have to provide a _target master_. In the current version of *BDeploy*, this is the official URL of the running *BDeploy* server. You will have to provide a _token_, which is the _<<_security,security token>>_ generated by the <<_bdeploy_cli,`bdeploy init`>> or the <<_bdeploy_cli,`bdeploy token`>> commands on the _master_.

[NOTE]
When creating additional *Instances*, you can choose to use the same _target master_ as an existing *Instance* within the same *Instance Group*. In this case, you will not have to enter a _token_ again.

==== Product Management

*Products* are managed in a very similar fashion to <<_software_repositories,*Software Repositories*>>.

Click the btn:[+] button to upload new *Products*. *Products* can be obtained by <<_building_a_product,building a *Product*>> or by downloading an existing version from another *Instance Group* on the same or another *BDeploy* server, using the btn:[Download] button on the *Product* details panel.

Once a *Product* is available, you can click it to open the *Product* details panel. This panel allows you to btn:[Download] a *Product* version as _ZIP_, or btn:[Delete] individual versions of the *Product* as long as it is not currently required by an *Instance* version. The btn:[Info] popup provides a list of all tags on that *Product* version.
