=== How can i see what's up and running?

The status of an *Instance* is visualized with icons in the *Instance Overview* page at several places:

[cols="1,3,3"]
|===

a| *Process Card*
a| image:images/BDeploy_Tutorial_Process_Card.png[align=center]
a| An icon on card shows the current status. No icon means the process is stopped.

a| *Process Control*
a| image:images/BDeploy_Tutorial_Process_Control.png[align=center]
a| The sidebar shows the current process status along with some additional information about the uptime. No icon means the process is stopped.

a| *Instance Version*
a| image:images/BDeploy_Tutorial_Process_Versions.png[align=center]
a| An icon on the card shows the cumulated status of _all_ processes of this version. No icon means that nothing is running in this version.

The <<_process_control,Process Control>> chapters provide more details about the individual process states along with a state graph that visualizes the life cycle of a process.
