=== How can I see what's up and running?

The status of an *Instance* is visualized in the *Instance Dashboard*.

. The individual process status is displayed with the according process - in the table row, or on the card, depending on the view mode.
. The indivifual process status is displayed in even more detail when clicking a process in the *Process Details Panel*.
. The overall *Node* state is displayed _above_ the individual process list, and is also visible in _collapsed mode_. This overall status displayes whether the current state is the expected state for a _running_ instance. More explicitly this means if there is a green checkmark, all processes of start type `INSTANCE` are running.

The <<_process_control,Process Control>> chapters provide more details about the individual process states along with a state graph that visualizes the life cycle of a process.
