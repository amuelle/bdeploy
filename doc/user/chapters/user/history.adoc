=== Instance History

After a while, you will probably end up with a lot of changes and new versions. +
You can *view* all those changes, *who* made them and *when* they were made on the *instance history page*.

To open the history, go to the *instance overview*, click on the *menu* on the right and click on *instance history*.

You will be greeted with *cards* on each side of a timeline.
Each *card* consists of a title containing the *event* and the corresponding *version*, as well as the *time* the event happened.

There are three types of events. _Creation_ events, that show a new version, _Deployment_ events that show _Installation_, _Activation_ and _Uninstallation_, and _Runtime_ for events like _starts_, _stops_, _crashes_, etc.

[NOTE]
If you haven't made any changes, only one card will be shown: _Version 1: Creation_.

Once you *scroll* to the bottom, a loading spinner will show up and more events get *loaded*. +
You can scroll on until you reach the first event.

To see the *user* responsible for a _Creation_ or _Deployment_, open a card by clicking on it. +
_Creation_ cards also list *all changes* of the corresponding version to the previous version.

[TIP]
To *close all* opened cards, click on the rightmost button of the toolbar on the top. +
If you want *only one* card open at once, click on the button to the left of it. With that on, once you open a new card, all other cards will be closed. 


===== Comparing two versions

You can *compare* any two versions to view all changes made between those versions. +
Select two versions by clicking on the button with *two arrows* in both _Creation_ cards. + 
The versions will show up under *_Compare Versions_* in the toolbar on the top.
To compare them now, click on the *arrow* inbetween.

A *dialog* listing all changes will show up.

===== Filtering events

To *select* which events are shown, click on the *filter button* on the left of _Compare Versions_ and enable/disable the shown events. +
_Runtime_ events are disabled by default.

===== Runtime events

_Runtime_ events will show up once you *enabled* them. 
_Runtime_ cards consist of a title containing the *event* and the corresponding *application*, as well as the *time* the event happened.

The body of _Runtime_ cards list the *node* and *version* of the application.

[NOTE]
The *process ID* will also show up given that it was present at the *moment* the event happened.
