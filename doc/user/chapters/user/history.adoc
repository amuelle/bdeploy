=== Instance History

After a while, you will probably end up with a lot of changes and new versions. +
You can *view* all those changes, *who* made them and *when* they were made on the *instance history page*.

To open the history, go to the *instance overview*, click on the *menu* on the right and click on *instance history*.

You will be greeted with _New version_ *cards* on each side of a timeline.
Each *card* consists of a title containing the *event* and the corresponding *version*, as well as the *time* the event happened.

There are three types of events. _New versions_ (configurations), _Deployments_ and _Runtime_ events. +
_Deployments_ and _Runtime_ events are disabled by default.

[NOTE]
If you haven't made any changes, only one card will be shown: _New version: 1_.

Once you *scroll* to the bottom, a loading spinner will show up and more events get *loaded*. +
You can scroll on until you reach the first event.

To see the *user* responsible for a _New version_, open a card by clicking on it. +
_New version_ cards also list *all changes* of the corresponding version to the previous version.

[TIP]
To *close all* opened cards, click on the rightmost button of the toolbar on the top. +
If you want *only one* card open at once, click on the button to the left of it. With that on, once you open a new card, all other cards will be closed. 

===== Comparing two versions

You can *compare* any two versions to view all changes made between those versions. +
Select two versions by clicking on the button with *two arrows* in both _New version_ cards. + 
The versions will show up under *_Compare Versions_* in the toolbar on the top.
To compare them now, click on the *arrow* inbetween.

A *dialog* listing all changes will show up.

==== Deployments

_Deployments_ are: `INSTALL`,`ACTIVATE`,`DEACTIVATE`,`UNINSTALL`.

_Deployments_ will show up once you *enabled* them. +
Each card consists of a title containing the *deployment type* and the corresponding *version*, as well as the *time* the event happened.

The body of a _Deployment_ card shows the *user* responsible for the *deployment*.

===== Runtime events

_Runtime_ events are: `START`, `STOP`, `CRASH`, `RESTART`, `PERMANENT CRASH`, `STOP PLANNED`.

_Runtime_ events will show up once you *enabled* them. +
Each card consists of a title containing the *event* and the corresponding *application*, as well as the *time* the event happened.

The body of a _Runtime_ card lists the *User* responsible for the event as well as the *node* and *version* of the application. +
If the not the user but the *process* or *bdeploy* triggered the _Runtime_ event, *_BDeploy System_* is shown as user.

[NOTE]
The *process ID* will also show up given that it was present at the *moment* the event happened.

==== Searching

You can *search* for specific events with the *search-bar* on the top.

After you entered your *search term* and hit *enter* or pressed the search *button* on the right,  +
all cards of which the *title*, *user* or *PID* contain your term, will show up.

To show everything again, *empty* the search bar first and then hit enter or press the search button.
