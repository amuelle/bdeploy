=== Instance History

After a while, you will probably end up with a lot of changes and new versions. You can *view* all those changes, *who* made them and *when* they were made on the *Instance History Page*. To open the history, go to the *Instance overview*, click on the *menu* on the right and click on *Instance History*.

A timeline with events on each side is shown. There are three types of events _Configuration_, _Deployments_ and _Runtime_ events. Each event has a title the corresponding *version*, as well as the *time* the event happened.

[NOTE]
_Deployments_ and _Runtime_ events are not displayed by default.

[NOTE]
If you haven't made any changes, only one card will be shown: _Version 1: Created_.

Once you *scroll* to the bottom, a loading spinner will show up and more events get *loaded*. You can scroll on until you reach the first event.

[TIP]
To *close all* opened cards, click on the rightmost button of the toolbar on the top.  If you want *only one* card open at once, click on the button to the left of it. With that on, once you open a new card, all other cards will be closed. 

==== Configuration Events

Each change that leads to a new *Instance Version* is a deployment event. Samples: Adding a new application, chaning the value of a parameter or changing the product version ...

The body of the card list *all changes* of the corresponding version to the previous version.

==== Deployment Events

_Deployments_ events are: `INSTALL`,`ACTIVATE`,`DEACTIVATE`,`UNINSTALL`.

_Deployments_ will show up once you *enabled* them. Each card consists of a title containing the *deployment type* and the corresponding *version*, as well as the *time* the event happened.

The body of a _Deployment_ card shows the *user* responsible for the *deployment*.

==== Runtime Events

_Runtime_ events are: `START`, `STOP`, `CRASH`, `RESTART`, `PERMANENT CRASH`.

_Runtime_ events will show up once you *enabled* them. Each card consists of a title containing the *runtime event* and the corresponding *application*, as well as the *time* the event happened.

The body of a _Runtime_ card lists the *User* responsible for the event as well as the *node* and *version* of the application. If the not the user but the *process* or *BDeploy* triggered the _Runtime_ event, *_BDeploy System_* is shown as user.

[NOTE]
The *Process ID* will also show up given that it was present at the *moment* the event happened.

You can *search* for specific events with the *search-bar* on the top.

After you entered your *search term* and hit *enter* or pressed the search *button* on the right, all cards of which the *title*, *user* or *PID* contain your term, will show up.

To show everything again, *empty* the search bar first and then hit enter or press the search button.

==== Comparing two versions

You can *compare* any two versions to view all changes made between those versions. Select two versions by clicking on the button with *two arrows*. The versions will show up under *_Compare Versions_* in the toolbar on the top. To compare them now, click on the *arrow* inbetween.
