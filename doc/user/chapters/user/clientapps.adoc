=== Client Applications

A dedicated overview page shows all configured *Client Applications* of an entire *Instance Group*. This page can be opened by navigating to the *Instance Browser* of the desired *Instance Group*. Clicking on the menu:Context Menu[Client Applications] menu opens the overview page.

The page will offer the appropriate *Client Application* based on the operating system that the user is currently using. Switching the OS can be done by clicking the desired operating system in the top right corner.

==== Launcher
*Client Application* are started through a special *Launcher* that needs to be installed on all client computers. The launcher is responsible for keeping the application up-to-date and to pass the configured parameters to the application.

==== Installer
An *Installer* is provided for each *Client Application* to make the installation as easy as possible. The installer does not have any prerequisites and can be downloaded and executed by any user. 

The *Installer* checks if the latest version of the *Launcher* is already installed. If not then the *Launcher* is downloaded and stored on the client computer. The user can then start a *Client Application* with the branded *Link* that is stored on the *Desktop* or in the *Start Menu*.

===== Windows
By default the *Launcher* is installed for the *Current User* in the _%LOCALAPPDATA%\BDeploy_ folder (_C:/Users/<user>/AppData/Local/BDeploy_). The location can be adopted by setting the *BDEPLOY_HOME* environment variable before launching the installer. No administrative privileges are required for this installation type. 

The *Launcher* can also be installed for *All* users by starting the installer with the */ForAllUsers* flag. The default location in that case is _%ProgramFiles%/BDeploy_ (_C:/Program Files/BDeploy_). The location can be adopted by setting the *BDEPLOY_HOME* environment variable before launching the installer. Ensure that all users have access to the customized location. Otherwise they cannot launch the application.

    ./Installer.exe /ForAllUsers

[NOTE]
Installation for *All* users requires administrative privileges. Additional configuration might be required depending on the installation location. See <<Multi-User Installations>> for more information.

===== Unattended Mode
The *Installer* can also be started in an unattended mode with the */Unattended* flag so that no UI is shown.

    ./Installer.exe /Unattended
    ./Installer.exe /Unattended /ForAllUsers

==== Linux

The *Installer* stores the *Launcher* and all *Client Applications* in _$HOME/.bdeploy_. This location can be changed by setting the environment variable *BDEPLOY_HOME*.

==== Click & Start
*Click & Start* enables the launching of *Client Application* by simply clicking a link in the web browser. In this case the applications are not integrated into the operating system (Start Menu, Desktop Shortcut). A prerequisite is that the *Click & Start Launcher* is deployed on the client computer. This can be done by using the *Click & Start Installer* available in the top-right corner of the *Client Applications* page. The installer will download the *Click & Start Launcher* and associate it with *.bdeploy* files. 

[NOTE]
The *Launcher* can also be manually deployed using the provided ZIP file. After downloading and unpacking the *Launcher* must be associated with *.bdeploy* files using the FileAssoc.exe on Windows or file-assoc.sh on Linux contained in the launcher.


Clicking on a _Click & Start_ link in the *Browser* will download a *.bdeploy* file that can be directly executed. A more elegant way is to configure the *Browser* to directly open the *.bdeploy* file type. Firefox as well as Chrome allows to configure this after the file has been downloaded.


==== Multi-User Installations

Larger organizations typically do not want to deploy client applications on each client computer. They prefer to install the client software on a central server and publish the software via Citrix or similar technologies so that all users have access to one shared instance. This has the advantage that the administrators are in control of the installation and can centralize the update handling. BDeploy supports such an installation szenario.

There are two different locations that are important in the context of deploying applications in a multi-user setup:

* *Installation Area* - The location where the launcher as well as all applications are installed. This location is typically protected by file system privileges so that an *Administrator* has full permissions and all other users have read permissions. This location is defined by the environment variable *BDEPLOY_HOME*.

* *User Area* - The per-user are where the launcher as well as each launched application is permitted to write files. This location is mandatory in case that the *Installation Area* is read-only. This location is defined by the environment variable *BDEPLOY_USER_AREA*.

===== Configuration

When the *Installation Area* is read-only the environment variable *BDEPLOY_USER_AREA* must be set for each user and must point to a directory that is writable for the user that wants to launch an application.

===== Installing new software

New software is typically installed by the *Administrator* that has full permissions in the *Installation Area*. The administrator is either using the provided *Installer* or a *Click & Start* file in order to install the new application. After that step the application is available and can be launched by each new user by using the *CLick & Start* file.

===== Updating software

Whenever a new *Product version* is *Activated* on the server the administrator *needs* to launch the application *once* to deploy the new update. Not doing that will lead to an error that each user receives when trying to launch the application. The *Launcher* always checks for updates and tries to install them. Using an outdated application is not permitted and thus users will not be able to launch the application any more.

[NOTE] 
Configuration changes in a client application - like adding, removing or changing a parameter - *do not* require *Administrator* attention since the installation itself is not affected. The change is automatically applied on the next start of the application.

[CAUTION]
Changing the product version or changing the launcher version on the server require a manual interaction of the *Administrator* otherwise *NO* user can use the client application anymore.
