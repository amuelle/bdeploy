=== Instance Group

An instance group acts as logical container for actual *Instances*. It typically contains several *Instances* for different purposes (productive, test, development). Adding them to the same group provides a better overview which of them are belonging together. An empty page is displayed if no instance has been created.

Use the btn:[+] button to create a new *Instance Group*.

[NOTE]
The name of an instance group cannot be changed. Be carful when choosing the name.

The page shows a list of _recently used_ *Instance Groups* in the first row. It will always contain the most recently used *Instance Groups* for the logged in user. This allows allows a quick return to previously/frequently visited *Instance Groups*.

[NOTE]
Of course you can also bookmark the location of an *Instance Group* in your browser.

Click on an *Instance Group* to open the *Instance Browser* of this group. Here you can see all *Instances* grouped by their _purpose_ (can be `DEVELOPMENT`, `TEST`, `PRODUCTIVE`)

Since an *Instance* requires a *Product*, an empty *Instance Group* will display a shortcut to the <<_product_management,Product Management>> dialog. If there is at least one *Instance* already, the shortcut disappears. The btn:[Manage Products...] button in the lower right corner opens the <<_product_management,Product Management>> dialog, too.

To create a new *Instance*, click the btn:[+] button at the bottom of the page. After giving the new *Instance* a name, purpose and description, the most important thing is to select the *Product* you want to deploy. The _tag_ of the *Product* has to be chosen to determine the initial product version. It can be changed later at anytime (_up-_ and _downgrade_). You will also have to provide a _target master_, which is the URL of the REST API provided by the *BDeploy* *Minion* that runs as *Master* on one of the target *Nodes*. In the current version of *BDeploy*, this is the official URL of the running *BDeploy* server. You will have to provide a _token_, which is the _<<_security,security token>>_ generated by the <<_bdeploy_cli,`bdeploy init`>> or the <<_bdeploy_cli,`bdeploy token`>> commands on the _master_.

[NOTE]
When creating additional *Instances*, you can choose to use the same _target master_ as an existing *Instance* within the same *Instance Group*. In this case, you will not have to enter a _token_ again.

Click an *Instance* to proceed to the <<_instance_configuration,Instance Configuration>>.

==== Product Management

Click the btn:[+] button to upload new *Products*. *Products* can be obtained by <<_building_a_product,building a *Product*>> or by downloading an existing version from another *Instance Group* on the same or another *BDeploy* server, using the btn:[Download] button on the *Product* details panel.

Once a *Product* is available, you can click it to open the *Product* details panel. This panel allows you to btn:[Download] a *Product* version as _ZIP_, or btn:[Delete] individual versions of the *Product* as long as it is not currently required by an *Instance* version. The btn:[Info] popup provides a list of all tags on that *Product* version.
