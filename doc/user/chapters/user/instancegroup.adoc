=== Instance Group

An *Instance Group* acts as logical container for actual *Instances*. It typically contains several *Instances* for different purposes (productive, test, development). Adding them to the same group provides a better overview which of them are belonging together. An empty page is displayed if no instance has been created.

Use the btn:[+] button to create a new *Instance Group*.

[NOTE]
The name of an instance group cannot be changed. Be carful when choosing the name.

The _Automatic Cleanup_ option helps to reduce the amount of consumed hard disk space. During the lifetime of an *Instance Group*, probably many new versions of a *Product* are deployed. To avoid that the hard disk is filled up with *Product Versions* that are not used anymore, there is an option to activate an automatic cleanup job. If the option _Automatic Cleanup_ is enabled, old *Product Versions* that are no longer in use by *Instances* of this *Instance Group* are deleted automatically. To avoid that a *Product* vanishes completely, the very latest *Product Version* always remains.

All the configured *Instance Groups* are shown in the *Instance Groups* dialog. This page shows a list of _recently used_ *Instance Groups* in the first row. It will always contain the most recently used *Instance Groups* for the logged in user. This allows allows a quick return to previously/frequently visited *Instance Groups*.

[NOTE]
Of course you can also bookmark the location of an *Instance Group* in your browser.

Click on an *Instance Group* to open the *Instance Browser* of this group. Here you can see all *Instances* grouped by their _purpose_ (can be `DEVELOPMENT`, `TEST`, `PRODUCTIVE`)

Since an *Instance* requires a *Product*, an empty *Instance Group* will display a shortcut to the <<Manage Products>> dialog. If there is at least one *Instance* already, the shortcut disappears. The btn:[Manage Products...] button in the lower right corner opens the <<Manage Products>> dialog, too.

==== Manage Products

Click the btn:[+] button to upload new *Products*. *Products* can be obtained by <<_building_a_product,building a *Product*>> or by downloading an existing version from another *Instance Group* on the same or another *BDeploy* server, using the btn:[Download] button on the *Product* details panel.

[NOTE]
On the BDeploy Releases page you will find some sample products for each release, see https://github.com/bdeployteam/bdeploy/releases

Once a *Product* is available, you can click it to open the *Product* details panel. This panel allows you to btn:[Download] a *Product* version as _ZIP_, or btn:[Delete] individual versions of the *Product* as long as it is not currently required by an *Instance* version. The btn:[Info] popup provides a list of all tags on that *Product* version.

==== Create New Instances

To create a new *Instance*, click the btn:[+] button at the bottom of the page. After giving the new *Instance* a name, purpose and description, the most important thing is to select the *Product* you want to deploy. Additionally, The initial *Product Version* has to be chosen. It can be changed later at anytime (_up-_ and _downgrade_). 

It is a common requirement that certain *Processes* of an *Instance* should be automatically started whenever the *BDeploy* server itself is started. To accomplish that, the _Automatic Startup_ flag of the *Instance* must be set. 

The *Instance* determines whether it is included in the automatic cleanup job. If the option _Automatic Uninstallation_ is enabled, the cleanup job will uninstall all *Instance Versions* that are older than the activated and the previously activated *Instance Version*. Due to this automatic uninstallation some of the old *Product Versions* might become unused. If the option _Automatic Cleanup_ is activated on the instance group, these unused *Product Versions* are deleted too (see <<_instance_group,Instance Group>>).
