=== Instance Overview

The *Instance Overview* is the central dialog for configuring and managing instances. It provides an overview about all configured *Applications* and on which nodes they are running. Each *Application* is represented by a *Process Card*. Colored markings on the card indicate whether a process still lacks mandatory configurations or whether there are still unsaved changes.

The first step is to select the desired applications from the *Configure Applications* panel distribute them to the *Nodes* in the *Instance* using drag and drop. The panel is called up via the pull-down menu of the dialog. The applications that are shown in this panel are defined by the *Product*. 

image::images/BDeploy_Instance_Menu.png[Instance Menu,align=center, width=480, link="images/BDeploy_Instance_Menu.png"]

The *Configure Applications* panel contains all server applications and all client applications of the product. Server applications can be dragged to *Server Nodes* (e.g. _master_), client applications can only be dragged to the (virtual) *Client Applications Node*. Clients that are available for more than one operating system expand to single cards per operating system on the *Client Node*. 

[NOTE]
The *Client Application Node* is not available if the product does not contain any client applications.

==== Process Settings

A *Process* is started by executing the *Start* command that is defined by the *Application*. The parameters that are passed to the *Process* are configured in the *Process Settings* dialog. This dialog can be accessed via the pull-down menu on the respective *Process Card*.

image::images/BDeploy_DnD_Applications.png[Drag & Drop Applications,align=center, width=480, link="images/BDeploy_DnD_Applications.png"]

The available parameters, their type and whether or not they are mandatory or optional are defined by the *Application*. The dialog groups the available parameters into categories, between which you can jump back and forth via btn:[Previous] and btn:[Next]. 

image::images/BDeploy_Process_Config.png[Process Parameter Configuration,align=center, width=480, link="images/BDeploy_Process_Config.png"]

[NOTE]
The *Application* defines in which order the parameters are passed to the *Process* this order cannot be changed for predefined parameters.

Behind each parameter there is a small popup that can contain a short description, a *Default Value* and a button for resetting the parameter to the *Default Value*.

*Validation Issues* are displayed per group in the respective title. Only complete configurations can be accepted.

[TIP]
You can use the _Search Bar_ in the _Parameter Settings_ header to search for and filter parameters. When searching only matching parameters are shown, groups without matches are hidden, and the _Manage Optional Parameters_ button will receive a badge indicating the number of matching _unconfigured_ parameters.

The context menu on an application card allows you to copy an application definition. This can be pasted on any node of the correct type using the context menu on the according node when in *Configure Applications* mode.

===== Optional Parameters

*Optional Parameters* can be selected for each group using the btn:[Manage Optional Parameters] dialog (available only if *Optional Parameters* are available) and then configured like other parameters.

image::images/BDeploy_Process_Optional_Configured.png[Configuring Optional Parameter(s), align=center, width=480, link="images/BDeploy_Process_Optional_Configured.png"]

===== Custom Parameters

*Custom Parameters* can be maintained in the last parameter group. Because all *Parameters* must have a determined sequence, *Custom Parameters* must define a predecessor parameter after which they are put on the command line.

image::images/BDeploy_Process_Custom_Create.png[Create Custom Parameter,align=center, width=480, link="images/BDeploy_Process_Custom_Create.png"]
image::images/BDeploy_Process_Custom_Value.png[Configure Custom Parameter,align=center, width=480, link="images/BDeploy_Process_Custom_Value.png"]

===== Global Parameters

*Global Parameters* are valid for all *Processes* of an *Instance*. They are also configured in the *Process*, but changes are copied to all other processes that also use this parameter. *Global Parameters* are matched by their parameter UID, and marked with a small globe in the *Process Configuration* dialog.

===== Conditional Parameters

*Conditional Parameters* are parameters which are only configurable if a specific dependent parameter has a certain value. These parameters are hidden until the dependent parameter meets the conditions requirements.

===== Variables

*BDeploy* provides a mechanism for defining that a parameter should hold a dynamically computed value instead of a fixed one. The general syntax for variables is `{{TYPE:VARNAME:SUBVAR}}`. With that mechanism it is possible to define that a certain parameter holds different values for different operating systems or to refer to parameters defined in a different process. See <<_variable_expansion,Variable Expansion>> for more details.

===== Command Line Preview

A preview of the command that is executed to launch this process can be viewed by clicking on the btn:[Show Command Line Preview] button that is displayed at the right side of the *Parameter Settings* header. The preview is especially useful in case of custom parameters to ensure that they are added as expected in the correct order.

==== Configuration Files

The *Configuration Files* of all *Processes* of an *Instance* are maintained together in one dialog. It can be opened by clicking on the btn:[Configuration Files] button in the pull-down menu of the *Instance*. The initial set of *Configuration Files* is derived from the default set delivered with the product, see <<_product_info_yaml,`product-info.yaml`>>.

image::images/BDeploy_CfgFiles_Browser.png[Configuration File Browser,align=center,width=480,link="images/BDeploy_CfgFiles_Browser.png"]

New configuration files can be be created using the btn:[+] button. This will open the integrated editor. 
Additionally to that existing files can be uploaded using the provided btn:[Upload] button.

===== File types

The type of a configuration file is automatically detected and visualized in the dialog. The following table shows the supported file types and how they are treated:

[%header,cols="^a,3,3,3,2"]

|===

===== Editor
The integrated editor provides syntax highlighting and rudimentary syntax checking for some basic file types (yaml, json, xml). Displayed problems are only to be seen as help and never interfere with the process, e.g. by preventing the saving of a file. Only files of type *Text* can be edited with the provided editor. *Binary* files can only be changed by uploading a new file with the same name.

image::images/BDeploy_CfgFile_New.png[Create New Configuration File,align=center,width=480,link="images/BDeploy_CfgFile_New.png"]
image::images/BDeploy_CfgFiles_Save.png[Modified Configuration Files,align=center,width=480,link="images/BDeploy_CfgFiles_Save.png"]

[NOTE]
Changes done in configuration files must be *Saved* and they result in a new *Instance Version* that must be *Installed* and *Activated* so that the changes have an impact. 

==== Change Product Version

*Instances* are based on a *Product Version*. While the *Product* of the *Instance* cannot be changed afterwards, the *Version* can be chosen from the available *Product Versions* (upgrade to a newer version / downgrade to an older version). 


If there's a newer *Product Version* available (newer than the one that is configured for the latest *Instance Version*), a notification is shown in the notification area.

image::images/BDeploy_Product_Notification.png[Notification about new Product Version,align=center,width=480,link="images/BDeploy_Product_Notification.png"]

Clicking on the notification opens the *Product Version* sidebar. The same sidebar can also be opened opened by clicking on the btn:[Change Product Version] button in the pull-down menu of the *Instance*. If the menu entry is disabled verify that the latest *Instance Version* is selected.

image::images/BDeploy_Product_Change.png[Change Current Product Version,align=center,width=480,link="images/BDeploy_Product_Change.png"]

The btn:[Info] Popup provides a list of all Labels on that *Product* version.

Changing the version can be done by clicking on the btn:[Upgrade] or btn:[Downgrade] button displayed at the right side of the product version card. Selecting another product version will automatically close the *Product Version* sidebar. The *Instance Version* sidebar is displayed and a new locally modified version has been created. 

image::images/BDeploy_Product_Upgrade_Local_Changes.png[Successful Product Tag Change,align=center,width=480,link="images/BDeploy_Product_Upgrade_Local_Changes.png"]

[NOTE]
All *Applications* are marked as modified as they are now based on a different *Product Version*.

Changing the *Product Version* can result in validation issues and automated adjustment of parameters. *Product Versions* can contain different *Applications*, so that with the change of the *Product Version* e.g. a previously configured *Application* must be deleted because it has been removed from the product. If parameters definitions are changed, validation errors may occur which must be corrected before saving (e.g. new mandatory parameters, parameters no longer supported, etc.). These errors will cause a visual indicator on affected applications, as well as a textual description of the problem in the notifications area.

image::images/BDeploy_Product_Downgrade_Validation.png[Validation Issues After Product Version Change,align=center,width=480,link="images/BDeploy_Product_Downgrade_Validation.png"]

==== Banner Message

A banner message can be created for an *Instance*, which is displayed very clearly at the top of the overview dialog. The foreground and background colors are freely definable, so that depending on the urgency or content of the message a suitable color, possibly a clear signal color, can be selected.
Banner messages are maintained on instance level and are not versioned, i.e. they are independent of instance versions. Therefore they outlast configuration changes of an instance. 

==== Import/Export

Instance versions can be exported and downloaded from the *Instance Version* card's context menu. This will download this specific instance version's raw data as a _ZIP_. This _ZIP_ will contain the complete instance configuration as well as all configuration files currently stored with the instance.

The content of the _ZIP_ can be edited offline, and re-imported using the *Instance*'s (not *Instance Version*) context menu to create a new *Instance Version*. The file structure inside the _ZIP_ must be exactly the same as when exporting.

[WARNING]
This mechanism allows access to the most internal data structures of *BDeploy*. Great care has to be taken to not damage any of the data on import.

==== Application Templates

A product may contain *Application Templates*. These are pre-defined configurations for applications, resulting in a more complete process configuration when dragged to the target node. If an application has an attached *Application Template*, it's application card will contain a drop down (_Choose Application Template_), which - when clicked - will show all available templates to choose from. 

image::images/BDeploy_Application_Template_Choose.png[Application Template Drop Down,align=center,width=480,link="images/BDeploy_Application_Template_Choose.png"]

After choosing a template, dragging the card to the target node as usual will create the process configuration from this template instead of starting from scratch. In case the template requires user input (i.e. it defines mandatory template variables), the user is prompted to fill them out before the process is created.

image::images/BDeploy_Application_Template_Variables.png[Application Template Variables,align=center,width=480,link="images/BDeploy_Application_Template_Variables.png"]

Finally, the process configuration is created from the application template using the given variable values.

[NOTE]
You will notice that the name of the process now matches the name of the template, not the name of the underlying application.

image::images/BDeploy_Application_Template_Process.png[Application Template Process,align=center,width=480,link="images/BDeploy_Application_Template_Process.png"]

==== Instance Templates

A product can define and include *Instance Templates*. These templates can be applied on an empty instance (e.g. after creating one). They can define processes just like *Application Templates*, in fact they can even include existing *Application Templates*.

[INFO]
The advantage of an *Instance Template* is that it can contain more knowledge of how processes need to be set up to work together, wheras *Application Templates* define configuration for a single application.

image::images/BDeploy_Instance_Template_Empty.png[Instance Template on empty instance,align=center,width=480,link="images/BDeploy_Instance_Template_Empty.png"]

The *Instance Template* link is only available if the product contains templates to start from. Clicking it will open up the *Instance Template* wizard.

image::images/BDeploy_Instance_Template_Dialog_Groups.png[Instance Template Dialog Group Selection,align=center,width=480,link="images/BDeploy_Instance_Template_Dialog_Groups.png"]

Selecting a template (here: _Default Configuration_) will show a list of _groups_ defined in the template. These _groups_ can be assigned to compatible nodes - groups containing server applications to server nodes, and groups containing client applications to the special _Client Applications_ node. Selecting _None_ as target node will skip the processes in this group. Click the (i) info icon to display details about a group, including all processes configured in the template group.

When creating configurations on a `SERVER` node, applications will be added matching the nodes OS. If a server application is included in a group which is not available for the target OS, it is ignored.

When creating configurations for a `CLIENT` group, applications are added to the _Client Applications_ virtual node, one for each OS supported by the application.

Clicking btn:[Next] will show a list of template variables to fill out. Template variables can be used by templates to query required user input, so all template variables are mandatory.

image::images/BDeploy_Instance_Template_Dialog_Variables.png[Instance Template Dialog Variables,align=center,width=480,link="images/BDeploy_Instance_Template_Dialog_Variables.png"]

Clicking btn:[Next] and then btn:[Close] once the template has been applied will create the processes defined in the template. The configuration will *not* be saved automatically, to allow further tuning of the configuration before doing so.
