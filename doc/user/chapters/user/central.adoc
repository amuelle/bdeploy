=== Central/Managed Specific Configuration

The <<Modes of Operation,Central/Managed Mode>> requires some configuration to attach `CENTRAL` and `MANAGED` servers.

On the `CENTRAL` server side:

* Each *Instance Group* has a list of `MANAGED` servers attached to it.
* Each *Instance* is associated with exactly *one* of those `MANAGED` servers.
* Synchonization to the `CENTRAL` servers data store is done on demand (through a button in the Web UI). When synchonizing from a `MANAGED` to a `CENTRAL` server, only _configuration_ data is synchronized. Actual *product* and *application* data is only synchronized when explicitly requested through the <<Product Synchronization>> page on the `CENTRAL` server.
* It is possible to create a new *Instance Version* on the `CENTRAL` server from a *Product Version* which has been pushed only to the `CENTRAL` server (but not to the `MANAGED`). In this case, the required product data is sent to the `MANAGED` server once *Install* is performed on this *Instance Version*.

On The `MANAGED` server side:

* Creation and editing of *Instance Group* (title, description, logo, etc.) is not possible locally. This has to happen on the `CENTRAL` server, as information *must* match.
* Creation and editing of *Instances* (applications, parameters, etc.) is possible just the same as with a `STANDALONE` server. New data will be synchronized to the `CENTRAL` server the next time the `CENTRAL` server requests such a synchronization.

[NOTE]
*BDeploy* is built for restrictive networks. The assumption is that the `CENTRAL` server can contact all its `MANAGED` servers, but never the other way around.

==== Attaching an Instance Group to a Central Server

You will notice that a `MANAGED` server will greet slightly different on the welcome page. Instead of a _create instance group_ button, there is an _attach instance group_ button, and the text reads accordingly.

Attaching an *Instance Group* is a two way operation.

* The `MANAGED` server needs to share some details about itself with the `CENTRAL` server. This happens either via drag & drop of an element from the `MANAGED` servers Web UI to the `CENTRAL` servers Web UI, or manually by downloading the `MANAGED` servers information and dropping that file to the `CENTRAL` servers Web UI.
* On the `CENTRAL` server, you will choose the *Instance Group* which should be attached. The *Instance Group* _must_ exist on the `CENTRAL` server. If the `MANAGED` server happens to have an *Instance Group* of the same name already (i.e. if the `MANAGED` server was migrated from `STANDALONE`), this is perfectly fine - *Instances* in this *Instance Group* will not be lost, they will be attached to the `CENTRAL` server instead.
* The `CENTRAL` server will try to contact the `MANAGED` server. You can provide an alternate URL to accomodate for hostname differences (different DNS, NAT, VPN, etc.) before it does so.
* Once contacted, the `CENTRAL` server will push the *Instance Group* meta-data to the `MANAGED` server, as the information on the `CENTRAL` is the single source of *Instance Group* configuration.
* Finally, the `CENTRAL` server will fetch all potentially existing *Instance* information from the `MANAGED` server. This is only relevant if the `MANAGED` server was migrated from `STANDALONE` mode before.

To attach in *Instance Group*, you need both Web UIs of `CENTRAL` and `MANAGED` server. Make sure you have both available and open in browsers next to each other (on the same machine, so drag & drop will work).

[NOTE]
You can easily distiguish `CENTRAL` and `MANAGED` servers by the according banner in the upper right corner of the Web UI.

On the `CENTRAL` server, choose menu:Context Menu[Managed Servers] on the *Instance Group* you want to attach. This will take you to the *Managed Servers* page for this *Instance Group*. Initially, this page will be empty.

image::images/BDeploy_Central_Managed_Servers.png[Managed Servers Page on Central, align=center, width=480, link="images/BDeploy_Central_Managed_Servers.png"]

Click the btn:[Attach Managed Server] button to initiate attaching a `MANAGED` server to this *Instance Group*.

image::images/BDeploy_Central_Attach_Drop.png[Attach Managed Server Wizard, align=center, width=480, link="images/BDeploy_Central_Attach_Drop.png"]

After the introductionary text, you will be prompted to drop `MANAGED` server information on a drop-zone. You can find the counterpiece on the `MANAGED` server. To initiate attaching on the `MANAGED` server, click the btn:[Attach Instance Group] button on the main *Instance Group* page (which is the initial start page of the Web UI). This will launch the _Attach to Central Server_ wizard.

image::images/BDeploy_Managed_Attach_Intro.png[Attach to Central Server, align=center, width=480, link="images/BDeploy_Managed_Attach_Intro.png"]

The next step in the wizard on the `MANAGED` server will provide the dragable card which needs to be dragged to the `CENTRAL` servers drop zone. Meanwhile, the `MANAGED` server will wait for an incoming connection from the `CENTRAL` server, once the information has been digested properly.

[NOTE]
Alternatively (e.g. if you cannot open both Web UIs on the same machine) you can click btn:[Continue Manually] to download the information as a file. This file can be copied to a machine where access to the `CENTRAL` server is possible. There you can drop the file to the drop-zone, instead of the dragable card.

Once the information is dropped on the according drop zone on the `CENTRAL` server, it will confirm a successful read of the information. Click btn:[Next].

image::images/BDeploy_Central_Attach_Read_Success.png[Successful read of Managed Server Information, align=center, width=480, link="images/BDeploy_Central_Attach_Read_Success.png"]

On the next step, you have the chance to provide an alternative URL as well as a description of the `MANAGED` server. The alternate URL should be reachable from the `CENTRAL` server and accomodate for any hostname mapping required (NAT, VPN, DNS, ...).

image::images/BDeploy_Central_Attach_Info.png[Additional Managed Server Information, align=center, width=480, link="images/BDeploy_Central_Attach_Info.png"]

Clicking btn:[Next] will initiate the actual attachment process. The `CENTRAL` server will contact the `MANAGED` server using the provided URL. It will then perform the initial synchronization of data. Once this is done, you will see a success notice which you can dismiss using the btn:[Done] button.

image::images/BDeploy_Central_Attach_Done.png[Additional Managed Server Information, align=center, width=480, link="images/BDeploy_Central_Attach_Done.png"]

You will be taken back to the *Managed Servers* page, which shows the newly attached `MANAGED` server and its state.

==== Instance Synchronization

Once a `MANAGED` server is attached to the `CENTRAL` server, *Instance* data can be synchronized from the `MANAGED` server on demand by the `CENTRAL` server. This can happen either from the *Managed Servers* page you saw before, by pressing btn:[Synchronize], or directly from the *Instance*. It is possible to synchronize both from the *Instance Browser* and from the *Instance Overview* page by pressing on the name of the `MANAGED` server. This element only exists on the `CENTRAL` server.

image::images/BDeploy_Central_Instance_With_Sync.png[Synchronize Managed Server, align=center, width=480, link="images/BDeploy_Central_Instance_With_Sync.png"]

[NOTE]
It is not required to synchronize the other way (`CENTRAL` to `MANAGED`) as this happens implicitly when performing changes to an *Instance*. Changes are actually performed *always* on the _controlling_ master, which is *always* the `MANAGED` server.

==== Migrating between Modes

There is a limited possibility to change the _purpose_ of an already intialized *BDeploy* server root directory. It is only possible to migrate from `STANDALONE` to `MANAGED` and vice versa, as data is _mostly_ compatible. A command line tooling exists for this purpose.

[source,bash]
----
bdeploy set-mode --root=<root-directory> --mode=MANAGED
----

The value for mode may be `MANAGED` or `STANDALONE`. The actual migration of data may be performed later on when first accessing them. For instance, when clicking an *Instance Group*, you might be prompted that an *Instance Group* requires to be attached to a `CENTRAL` server in `MANAGED` mode, and the *Attach to Central Server* wizard is launched.

[NOTE]
*BDeploy* server root directories are assumed to be of mode `STANDALONE` if they have been initilized with a *BDeploy* version prior to _1.4.0_.

==== Product Synchronization

When working with `CENTRAL` and `MANAGED` servers, products can be uploaded to either of the servers. However, a product version must be available on the server which is used to update an *Instance* to that version.

The recommended way of working is to exclusively use the `CENTRAL` server for all tasks, e.g. pushing new product versions, changing configuration, etc. When _installing_ an *Instance* version to the target server, the required product data is automatically transferred as part of the process.

Sometimes it might still be necessary to transfer product versions from one server to another. For instance, a product version was directly pushed to `MANAGED` server _A_, but is required as well on `MANAGED` server _B_. In this case you can use the *Product Synchronization* wizard to copy product versions from one server to another.

You can find the wizard on the *Manage Products* page on the `CENTRAL` server. The additional btn:[Synchronize] button is only available on the `CENTRAL` server.

image::images/BDeploy_Product_Sync_Button.png[Synchronize Product Versions Button, align=center, width=480, link="images/BDeploy_Product_Sync_Button.png"]

Clicking it will launch the synchronization wizard. It allows to choose a _source_ as well as a _target_ server. You can choose both from all available `MANAGED` servers and the `CENTRAL` server.

image::images/BDeploy_Product_Sync_Wizard.png[Choose Source and Target, align=center, width=480, link="images/BDeploy_Product_Sync_Wizard.png"]

Clicking btn:[Next] will fetch available products from the _source_ server. Once you choose a product from the drop-down, all available product versions are fetch from _both_ servers. You will be presented a list of versions which are not yet available on the _target_ server.

image::images/BDeploy_Product_Sync_Version.png[Choose Product Versions, align=center, width=480, link="images/BDeploy_Product_Sync_Version.png"]

Clicking the _arrow_ button on a product version, or dragging the version to the target list will mark this version as _to-be-synchronized_. Once satisfied with the selection, click btn:[Next] to initiate the transfer of the product versions from _source_ to _target_.

[NOTE]
If both _source_ and _target_ are `MANAGED` servers, the `CENTRAL` server will also receive the product version as a side-effect.

The wizard will show progress information while the transfer is active. Once the transfer is done, the wizard will tell accordingly.
