=== Process Control

For the activated *Instance Version*, the *Process Control* of this *Process* can be displayed by clicking on a *Process Card*. The upper part of the *Process Control Sidebar* shows the current *Process Status*. Below this, the control elements for _starting_, _stopping_ or _restarting_ the process can be found.

In addition to the actions for individual processes, the pull-down menu of the dialog contains the actions for _starting_, _stopping_ or _restarting_ the entire *Instance*, i.e. all *Processes* configured with start type `INSTANCE`.

==== Process Status

The process status is visualized with an icon in the bottom right corner of each *Process Card* and on the *Process Control Sidebar*. The *Instance Version* card displays the cumulated status of all *Processes* running in this version. A *Process* can have one of the following states:

[%header,cols="1,6"]
|===
| Icon
| Description

| 
| Process is *stopped*.

a| image::images/BDeploy_Process_Status_Running.png[width=32,align=center]
| Process is *running*.

a| image::images/BDeploy_Process_Status_Running_Version.png[align=center,width=32]
| Process is *running* in another version.

a| image::images/BDeploy_Process_Status_Crashed_Temporary.png[align=center,width=32]
| Process *crashed* unexpectedly. *Process Control* scheduled an automatic restart. No interaction required.

a| image::images/BDeploy_Process_Status_Crashed.png[align=center,width=32]
| Process *crashed* unexpectedly. *Process Control* gave up restarting as the last 5 attempts failed. *Manual interaction required*.

The life cycle of a process is visualized in the following state graph:

image::images/BDeploy_Process_State_Graph.png[Process State Graph,align=center,width=480,link="images/BDeploy_Process_State_Graph.png"]

==== Process Out-Of-Sync
An warning message - *Out-Of-Sync* - is displayed whenever one or more *Processes* are running in a version that is currently not *Activated*. This happens when *Deploying* a new version while *Processes* are still running. 

image::images/BDeploy_Process_Out_Of_Sync.png[align=center, width=480, link="images/BDeploy_Process_Out_Of_Sync.png"]

In principle this is nothing to worry about. It is just a remainder that the configuration has changed. The *Processes* will remain running in their current version until they are actively restarted. The message cannot be confirmed / closed as it automatically disappear once all *Processes* are running in the *Activated* version.

==== Process Start Type

The *Start Type* of a *Process* can be configured in the *Process Configuration* dialog. The available options are depending on the *Application*. That means the publisher of an *Application* defines which *Start Types* are supported. The following types are available:

[%header,cols="1,6"]
|===
| Name
| Description

| MANUAL
| Process must be started manually. No automatic startup will be done.

| MANUAL_CONFIRM
| Process must be started manually and an additional confirmation is required. 

| INSTANCE
| Process will be started automatically *if* the _Automatic Startup_ flag of the *Instance* is set. 

|===

It is a common requirement that certain *Processes* of an *Instance* should be automatically started whenever the *BDeploy* server itself is started. To accomplish that, the _Automatic Startup_ flag of the *Instance* must be set. This can be done in the *Instance Configuration* dialog. Additionally the *Start Type* of the *Process* must set to *Instance*. This can be done in the *Process Configuration* dialog.


*Processes* that are executing actions that cannot be reverted or that are potentially dangerous in productive environments (dropping a database, deleting files) should be configured with the start type *MANUAL CONFIRM*. Doing that results in an additional popup dialog that enforces the user to enter the name of the *Process* before it is started. The idea is, that the user takes an additional moment to ensure that he is really starting the desired *Process*.

==== Keep Alive

If the *Keep Alive* flag for a *Process* is configured then the *Process Control* restarts it when it crashes unexpectedly. The first restart attempt is immediately executed after the process terminates. Subsequent attempts are delayed. That means the *Process Control* waits a given time period until the next start attempt is executed. Such a situation is visualized in the UI with a red-warning icon where normally the green heart is displayed.

image::images/BDeploy_Process_Crashed.png[Crashed Server Process (temporarily),align=center,width=480,link="images/BDeploy_Process_Crashed.png"]

The *Process Control* will give up restarting a process after a total of 5 unsuccessful restart attempts. Such a situation is visualized in the UI with a red error icon. This icon means that the user has to manually check why it is failing and restart it if desired.

==== View stdout / stderr

Clicking on the terminal icon displayed below the process control actions will open a live stream of the *stdout* as well as *stderr* stream of the running *Process*. This allows a quick health check to ensure that everything is as expected.

==== Process listing

Clicking on the gear icon below the process control will open a popup showing all operating system processes that have been started by this *Process*.

==== Data Files

The *Data Files* dialog lists all files that are stored in the data directory of each minion. Files can be downloaded or opened directly in the the UI. The table is by default sorted by the last modification timestamp. Thus the newest files displayed first. The dialog utilizes pagination and only the top 10 files are shown. This can be changed using the toolbar below the table.

When opened in place, the btn:[Follow] toggle allows to grab new output as it is written on the server.
