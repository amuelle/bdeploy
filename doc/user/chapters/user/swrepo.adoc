=== Software Repositories

The *Software Repositories* page allows maintenance of external software that a specific product requires. A *Software Repository* shares its namespace with *Instance Groups*, which means that the unique name of a *Software Repository* must not collide with any name of a *Software Repository* or *Instance Group*.

The available software packages can be viewed and downloaded if required. Please note that uploading a new software package requires a special data structure. Simply uploading an arbitrary ZIP file is not working as the required *Metadata* is missing.
