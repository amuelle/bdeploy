=== System Maintenance

There are several components in the Web UI which allow maintenance of *BDeploy*. These are not to be used during _normal_ operation by users. They _are_ required during setup and to maintain current software versions of *BDeploy* itself if not done using the `<<_bdeploy_cli,bdeploy remote-master>>` CLI.

==== System Software

The btn:[System Software] page offers a mechanism to upload new *BDeploy* software versions, deploy these versions (_upgrade_ and _downgrade_ possible) to the running *BDeploy* _master_ and attached _slaves_.

It also offers a way to upload, and more important also to _download_ *BDeploy Launcher* binaries. These binaries are required when <<_app_info_yaml,`CLIENT` type *Applications*>> are configured.

Initially, the btn:[System Software] page contains only the running *BDeploy* system software version, and no *BDeploy Launcher*. Use the btn:[+] button to upload either new *BDeploy* or *BDeploy Launcher* versions from their respective binary distributions (_ZIP_).

The page can also be used to download the binaries of *BDeploy* (e.g. to setup additional _slaves_) and the *BDeploy Launcher* binaries (e.g. for manual setup of the *BDeploy Launcher* on client PCs, see <<_client_download,Client Download>>).

==== Manual Cleanup

You can use the btn:[Manual Cleanup] page from the main menu to perform manual cleanup on a _master_. This page is only available and useful on _master_ nodes.

[NOTE]
The dialog allows to manual execute the exact same cleanup (and reviewing of the actions performed _before_ doing so) as the master _cleanup job_ performs automatically on its `<<_bdeploy_cli,bdeploy cleanup>>` schedule.

Press the btn:[Calculate Cleanup Actions] button to perform cleanup calculation. The result will be a list of actions to be performed on each connected slave.

Press the btn:[Execute all Actions] button to actually perform the calculated actions.

[NOTE]
The dialog automatically resets itself after a certain timeout. This is to prevent execution of too old actions which might no longer be valid.

==== BHive Browser

[CAUTION]
The BHive Browser is an internal tool for administrative purposes. It has the power to destroy _everything_ - use with extreme caution.

==== Log Level

You can adjust the log level of the Web UI (i.e. logging in the Browser Console) using the drop down at the bottom of the BDeploy main menu. The default value depends on whether the application is started in development (i.e. from VSCode) or production mode.
