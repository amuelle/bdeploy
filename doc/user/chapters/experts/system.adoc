=== Administration

There are several components in the Web UI which allow maintenance of *BDeploy*. These are not to be used during _normal_ operation by users. They _are_ required during setup and to maintain current software versions of *BDeploy* itself if not done using the `<<_bdeploy_cli,bdeploy remote-master>>` CLI.

==== General Settings

_Gravatar_ support can be enabled in the general _Look & Feel_ settings.

==== Authentication

*BDeploy* supports both built-in and external authentication mechanims. The built-in user authentication can be disabled completely in the settings.

On the *LDAP* tab, you can configure a list of LDAP servers which should also be queried when authenticating a user.

image::images/BDeploy_LDAP_Servers.png[BDeploy LDAP Servers,align=center,width=480,link="images/BDeploy_LDAP_Servers.png"]

You can use the up and down arrows to control the order in which LDAP servers are queried for users that log on.

*BDeploy* uses simple bind to authenticate users. First, a simple bind is made with a configured _Server User_. This user must have permissions to list other users that should be able to log into *BDeploy*. This bind is used to query for a user where the `Result User Field` matches the given (at login) user name. This can be any field like `user`, `sAMAccountName`, or even `mail` if you want users to log on using their E-Mail Address. Once the user to log on is found, it's distinguished name is used to perform another simple bind using the login-provided password. Once this succeeds the user is authenticated and an according record is created in *BDeploy*. From that point on, permissions can be granted to this user.

===== LDAP Server Properties

The following properties can be configured for each LDAP Server:

[%header,cols="2,3"]
|===
| Property
| Description

| Server URL
| The URL of the LDAP server. Both `ldaps://` (with a proper certificate on the server) and `ldap://` are supported. `ldaps://` should be preferred where possible. Self-signed certificates are currently not configurable inside *BDeploy* (although they can be configure on the operating system).

| Server User
| The user which is used to query other users on the LDAP server

| Server Password
| The password for the _Server User_ which is used to query other users on the LDAP server.

| Account Base
| Root of the LDAP tree containing all user accounts to query. Typically in the form of `dc=domain,dc=com`.

| Account Pattern
| A partial LDAP query expression. Multiple filters can be written one after another. The final LDAP query is built by prepending `(&`, and appending a filter which queries the configures _Result User Field_ for the given user. Thie means that a pattern `(field1=value1)(field2=value2)` will result in a query like `(&(field1=value1)(field2=value2)(sAMAccountName=<GIVEN USER>))`.

| Result User Field
| Specifies the field which must match the given username when querying for the user.

| Result Full Name Field
| The field which should be used as source for the _Full Name_ of the user, which is used as a display name in <<User Accounts>> management.

| Result E-Mail Field
| The field which should be used as source for the users _E-Mail Address_. This is used for instance to query _Gravatar_ if _Gravatar_ support has been enabled in the <<General Settings>>.

==== BDeploy Update

The *BDeploy Update* page from the *Administration* menu offers a mechanism to upload new *BDeploy* software versions, deploy these versions (_upgrade_ and _downgrade_ possible) to the running *BDeploy* _master_ and attached _slaves_.

image::images/BDeploy_System_With_Launcher.png[BDeploy System Software,align=center,width=480,link="images/BDeploy_System_With_Launcher.png"]

It also offers a way to _upload_ and also to _download_ *BDeploy Launcher* binaries. These binaries are required when <<_app_info_yaml,`CLIENT` *Applications*>> are configured. Use the btn:[Upload] button to upload new *BDeploy* versions from the binary distributions (_ZIP_). 

The page can also be used to download the binaries of *BDeploy* (e.g. to setup additional _slaves_) and the *BDeploy Launcher* binaries (e.g. for manual setup of the *BDeploy Launcher* on client PCs, see <<_client_applications,Client Applications>>).

==== Manual Cleanup

You can use the *Manual Cleanup* page from the *Administration* menu to trigger a manual cleanup of stuff that is not needed any more. There is no need to trigger this manually as a job is scheduled that performs the exact same operation every night: 

[%header,cols="2,3"]
|===
| Target
| Description

| *Instances* with _Auto Uninstallation_ enabled
| If the option _Automatic Uninstallation_ is enabled on an *Instance*, *Instance Versions* that are older than the activated and the previously activated *Instance Version* are uninstalled automatically.

| *Instance Groups* with _Automatic Cleanup_ enabled
| If the option _Auto Cleanup_ is enabled on an *Instance Group*, old *Product Versions* that are no longer in use by *Instances* of this *Instance Group* are deleted automatically. To avoid that a *Product* vanishes completely, the very latest *Product Version* always remains.

| Slave
| Delete *Manifests* that are not known by the master

| Slave
| Keep two *BDeploy Launcher* versions, delete all older versions.

| Slave
| Remove unused directories and files in the deployment (including pooled applications), download and temp directory.

|===

The dialog can be used to immediately trigger a cleanup and to reviewing of the actions performed _before_ doing so. 

image::images/BDeploy_Cleanup.png[BDeploy Cleanup Page,align=center,width=480,link="images/BDeploy_Cleanup.png"]

Press the btn:[Calculate Cleanup Actions] button to perform cleanup calculation. The result will be groups of actions to be performed on *Instance Groups* or *Slaves*. The result contains only *Instance Groups* and *Slaves* for which actions are actually calculated, i.e. empty lists are hidden. If no action is calculated at all, a corresponding message is displayed.

image::images/BDeploy_Cleanup_Actions.png[BDeploy Cleanup Actions,align=center,width=480,link="images/BDeploy_Cleanup_Actions.png"]

Press the btn:[Execute all Actions] button to actually perform the calculated actions.

[NOTE]
The dialog automatically resets itself after a certain timeout. This is to prevent execution of too old actions which might no longer be valid.

==== BHive Browser
The *BHive Browser* from the *Administration* menu is an internal tool for administrative purposes. It allows viewing and browsing the internals of the *BDeploy* storage. The drop-down at the top of the dialog is used to switch between the available hives. The _default_ hive is the internal storage where metadata about users and outer hives are stored. The actual data is stored in the individual hives itself.

[CAUTION]
It has the power to destroy _everything_ - use with extreme caution.

==== Metrics

This dialog provides a quick way to investigate potential performance issues in the server itself by providing access to the in-memory metrics kept track by the server for all actions and requests performed.

==== Log Level

You can adjust the log level of the Web UI (i.e. logging in the Browser Console) using the drop down at the bottom of the BDeploy main menu. The default value depends on whether the application is started in development (i.e. from VSCode) or production mode.
