=== Nodes

*Nodes* are optional and only required in case that the application that you want to deploy should run on different servers but be managed from a certain master. By default a master is itself a node as well where applications can be deployed to. 

==== Initializing
*Nodes* must be initialized on the according machines (or on the same machine using non-default ports; the default port is 7701). 
The command is similar to the one used to initialize the *master*. Pass (for example) `--port=7702` to change the
default port to some other value to avoid conflicts. Running multiple *BDeploy* nodes on the same machine is
supported for testing, but not recommended for productive setups (as the *master* can be deployed to directly anyway - no need for an explicit *node*).

 bdeploy init --root=/path/to/node/storage --hostname=<hostname> --nodeIdentFile=node-ident.txt --port=7702 --mode=node

Note the `--nodeIdentFile` parameter given to the `init` command. It will contain the required access information for this *node*. You need it to register the *node* with the *master*, so make sure you will have it available when doing so.

==== Launch
After the initialization - which needs to be done only once - the *node* can be started with the following command:

 bdeploy start --root=/path/to/storage

==== Administration
To register, remove or manage a *node* on the *master* you can either use the command line interface or the administrative Web UI on the *master*.

===== Command line interface

Use the CLI to register, remove or manage a *node* on the *master* (see the `bdeploy remote-node --help` command for more information).

 bdeploy remote-node --remote=https://master-host:7701/api --tokenFile=master-token.txt --add=node-name --nodeIdentFile=node-ident.txt

[NOTE]
Both the `https` (beware the `s`) prefix and the `/api` suffix are required in all *BDeploy* URIs.

The *node* is now registered as 'node-name'. This is the name which is reported when querying *nodes* from the *master*.
This is also the name displayed when configuring applications to run on certain *nodes* later on.

===== Administrative Web UI

The administrative Web UI provides the ability to add, remove, repair, and otherwise manage *nodes*.

To add a new node, click the `Add Node...` button. In the resulting panel you can drag and drop the `node-ident.txt` file created during the initialization step. This will prefill the panel with the required information. You can change node-name and URI according to your needs before saving.

[NOTE]
In case you do not have the `node-ident.txt` file to drop to the drop zone, you can also drag the _content_ of the file as plain text to the drop zone - this has the same effect.

When editing an existing node by selecting it in the list, you can also drop the same `node-ident.txt` file to update the information. This way you can create nodes before they actually exist - using a dummy URI and authentication - and later on update the node administration with the actual configuration. This allows to configure instances to their future nodes without them existing yet.
