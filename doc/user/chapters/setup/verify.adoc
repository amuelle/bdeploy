=== Verify Setup

Make sure that all master and slave services are running on the according nodes by starting the created services or by starting them manually.
To verify that the setup is OK, run on the master:

 bdeploy remote-master --minions --remote=https://localhost:7701/api --tokenFile=token.txt

This will provide output like this:

 NAME                 STATUS                       START OS         VERSION
 master               ONLINE            1/21/19, 4:43 PM LINUX      1.0.0.e32e
 slave                OFFLINE

If any of the nodes is marked offline, the according minion on the respective node is not reachable from the master node.
