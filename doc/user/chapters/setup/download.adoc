=== Download

The latest and greatest BDeploy version can be downloaded on the official Github page: https://github.com/bdeployteam/bdeploy/releases

Extract the BDeploy binaries from the distribution ZIP. There is no requirement regarding the location of the binaries. 
The target of the unpack will contain a _bin/bdeploy_ or _bin/bdeploy.bat_ depending on whether the distribution is
built for linux (e.g. _bdeploy-linux64-x.x.x.zip_) or windows (e.g. _bdeploy-win64-x.x.x.zip_).

For easier handling, make sure the unzipped 'bin' folder is on the PATH. The rest of the manual assumes you have done
this, otherwise simply prefix all commands with the correct path to the binaries.
