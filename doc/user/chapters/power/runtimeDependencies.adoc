=== Runtime Dependencies

As you saw before (`<<_app_info_yaml,app-info.yaml>>`), *Applications* can declare dependencies to third-party *Manifests*. These *Manifests* are hosted in *Software Repositories* on the *BDeploy* Server.

To make them available on the server, you need to:

* Use `bhive import` to import the directory containing the third-party software into a local *BHive*.
* Use `bhive push` to push the created *Manifest* to the *Software Repository* of your choice.

Alternatively the Web UI provides a mechanism to upload arbitrary software to *Software Repositories*.

==== Manifest Naming

Third party software *Manifests* can have basically any name. If you want to provide different *Manifests* per target operating system though, you will have to follow a simple naming rule: append the operating system name to the *Manifest* name part, e.g.:

* `my/external/software/windows:1.0.0`
* `my/external/software/linux:1.0.0`

It can then be referenced by an `app-info.yaml` using the short-hand syntax `my/external/software:1.0.0` and *BDeploy* will choose the correct one depending on the target operating system.

=== Runtime Dependency Packaging

*BDeploy* will always make sure that your products are self contained. This means that <<Runtime Dependencies>> are packaged with the product data at build time. The result is a product which contains all dependencies. This also means that pushing a product to a target server does not require *any* prerequisites on that target server.

[NOTE]
Included runtime dependencies will not show up on the target server's Web UI anywhere. Especially there is no <<Software Repositories,Software Repository>> created automatically for any third-party software. It is simply included in the product.

=== Software Repositories

*Software Repositories* are a storage location for any external software required by products. In addition, BDeploy products can be stored and managed in *Software Repositories*, from where they can be transferred (imported) to *Instance Groups*. A *Software Repository* shares its namespace with *Instance Groups*, which means that the unique name of a *Software Repository* must not collide with any name of a *Software Repository* or *Instance Group*.

==== Upload software

To upload external software, open a software repository and click on the btn:[Upload Software] button in the toolbar. Then click on *browse* or *drop files*. You can upload zip packages.

After uploading arbitraty content, you need to specify the *name* of the software, the *version* and the supported *operating systems*.
If you already have a package in a BHive format or a package including a product descriptor containing all of this metadata, the available information will be used automatically.

After all requested information is entered, click *Import* to finally import the files to the *Software Repository*.

If the upload was succesful, the software for each operating system will show up.

The available software packages and products can be viewed and *downloaded* if required.

==== Software Repositories Access

*Software Repositories* are created and managed by global administrators. A *Software Repository* is always visible and readable for all users (exception: `CLIENT` permission users). `WRITE` permissions are required to manage the software packages in the repository. To be able to upload software, a user therefore requires `ADMIN` or `WRITE` permissions either globally, or assigned in the *Software Repository Permissions* panel.

The *Software Repository Permissions* panel works very similar to the <<Instance Group Access,*Instance Group Permissions*>>.
