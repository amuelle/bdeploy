  <!-- not using switch intentionally as there is no type checking on it. ngIf has full type checking -->
  <div *ngIf="field === 'cfg.name'">The name of the process configuration, not to be confused with the name of the application launched by the process.</div>
  <div *ngIf="field === 'cfg.control.startType'">
    The start type of the process. This controls how a process can be started and whether it is considered <em>vital</em> for the instance.
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>INSTANCE</strong>: The process will be started/stopped when bulk controlling the instance, and is considered <em>vital</em>, i.e. the instance
        receives a warning marker if the process is not running.
      </li>
      <li><strong>MANUAL</strong>: The process will never be started automatically. A user needs to manually start the process.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>MANUAL_CONFIRM</strong>: Same as <strong>MANUAL</strong>, except that the user will additionally be prompted to confirm starting the
        application.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div *ngIf="field === 'cfg.control.keepAlive'">
    Determines whether BDeploy tries to keep the process alive upon exit, restarting it after an increasing back-off period.
  </div>
  <div *ngIf="field === 'cfg.control.noRetries'">
    The amount of times BDeploy will try to restart a process which has <em>Keep Alive</em> enabled after the processes exited. The number of retries is reset
    once the process has been running for a certain amount of time.
  </div>
  <div *ngIf="field === 'cfg.control.gracePeriod'">
    The time that BDeploy will wait for the process to shut down once instructed to do so. If the process does not exit within this time, BDeploy will start to
    apply more force.
  </div>
  <div *ngIf="field === 'cfg.control.attachStdin'">
    Determines whether the console in the UI should be attached remotely to the processes <em>stdin</em> stream. This allows to send commands to the process if
    the process supports this.
  </div>
  <div *ngIf="field === 'cfg.executable'">The main command executed by BDeploy when running the process.</div>
